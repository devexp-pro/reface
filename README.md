# Reface

[![JSR](https://jsr.io/badges/@vseplet/reface)](https://jsr.io/@vseplet/reface)

**Reface** is a web framework designed for creating
[Hypermedia-Driven Applications](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/)
without a build step, based on HTMX. 

In this tool, I strive to combine the power
of SSR, SPA, and component-based architecture while using plain HTML, CSS, and
JS. I came up with the idea for this tool as a result of trying to optimize the development of TWA (Telegram Web Apps) using Deno and Deno Deploy. Traditional approaches that push for building and maintaining complex data APIs to support SPAs in React or Vue seem excessively cumbersome, complex, and costly to me.
